Project Outline
My project is a memes search engine, indexing the top 100 memes from the Imgflip API: https://api.imgflip.com/. They are searchable by name - using Algolia instant search - and also display the meme image.

What I intended to accomplish
I intended to use an external public API to populate Algolia via API and add relevance programatically. I also intended these to be filterable by category, but the API did not provide this data.

Feedback for Algolia
Good exercise to get into the product - easy and quick to set up.
